Introduction to Computer Vision

What is Computer Vision?

Computer Vision is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to interpret and understand the visual world. It involves acquiring, processing, analyzing, and understanding digital images and videos to extract meaningful information.

Applications of Computer Vision

1. Object Detection and Recognition
Computer Vision systems can detect and recognize objects in images or videos, enabling applications such as:

Autonomous vehicles
Surveillance systems
Augmented reality
2. Image Classification
Computer Vision algorithms classify images into predefined categories, useful for:

Medical imaging diagnosis
Quality control in manufacturing
Content-based image retrieval
3. Image Segmentation
Segmenting images into regions of interest allows for:

Medical image analysis
Scene understanding
Background removal in photography
4. Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
OCR systems extract text from images, essential for:

Document digitization
License plate recognition
Handwriting recognition
Key Concepts in Computer Vision

1. Feature Extraction
Identifying distinctive features in images, such as edges, corners, or blobs, used for matching and recognition tasks.

2. Image Filtering
Applying filters to images for tasks like noise reduction, edge detection, or smoothing.

3. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Deep learning models specifically designed for processing visual data, widely used in image classification and object detection tasks.

4. Image Transformation
Techniques such as scaling, rotation, or affine transformations applied to images for preprocessing or augmentation purposes.

Tools and Libraries
